                    漢皇重色思傾國，御宇多年求不得。楊家有女初長成，養在深閨人未識。
                    天生麗質難自棄，一朝選在君王側。回眸一笑百媚生，六宮粉黛無顏色。
                    春寒賜浴華清池，溫泉水滑洗凝脂。侍兒扶起嬌無力，始是新承恩澤時。
                    雲鬢花顏金步搖，芙蓉帳暖度春宵。春宵苦短日高起，從此君王不早朝。
                    承歡侍宴無閒暇，春從春遊夜專夜。後宮佳麗三千人，三千寵愛在一身。
                    金屋妝成嬌侍夜，玉樓宴罷醉和春。姊妹弟兄皆列土，可憐光彩生門戶。
                    遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女。驪宮高處入青雲，仙樂風飄處處聞。
                    緩歌慢舞凝絲竹，盡日君王看不足。漁陽鼙鼓動地來，驚破霓裳羽衣曲。
                    Tang Emperor Xuanzhong lusted after a beauty worthy of taking a country to war for,
                    For so many years of his reign, unfulfilled his wish remained.
                    There was a Yang family whose daughter had come of age,
                    She was well kempt in her boudoir unknown to the social scene.
                    Yet her natural beauty had spelt her destiny that could not be forsaken,
                    Into the palace she did go and by the Emperor's side she was received.
                    As she turned her head, one smile enchanted all,
                    Outshining all women in the Palace who in comparison had their colour lost.
                    In spring chill, the Emperor bestowed on her a bath in the Splendid Pond,
                    A natural thermal spa with salubrious waters to her milky skin cleanse;
                    A maid helped to support her lady-like delicacy,
                    Thus began the Emperor's adoration of this fair lady.
                    She had a florid face and cloud-soft hair adorned with glittering golden beads that swayed,
                    Behind bedchamber curtains painted with lotus, springtime passion was in play;
                    Springtime passion made speed of night and in no time the sun had risen high,
                    The Emperor stopped attending the morning assembly on state affairs.
                    Pleasing the Emperor and accompanying him at banquets took up all of her time,
                    Springtime is for garden wayfaring and the night-time for bedchamber private affairs.
                    The Emperor's beauty mansions held three thousand fair ladies,
                    Whom the Emperor could have adored but he chose to dote on Lady Yang alone.
                    In her gilded chamber she prepared for the Emperor's night entertainment,
                    After a banquet on a majestic pavilion she'd waver down in sensual high.
                    All of her brothers and sisters were awarded with prominent official titles,
                    All the power and glory because of her on one family fell.
                    Hence all fathers and mothers of the world,
                    Would rather than boys girls bear and raise.
                    The Li Palace soared into the sky among clouds,
                    From there heavenly music drifted in the wind far and wide.
                    Soothing singing and amatory dancing intertwined with strings and pipes,
                    The Emperor indulged day and night ever wanting more.
                    Until suddenly war drums from Yuyang had the capital's earth quaking,
                    Sprung out of tune was Lady Yang's dance in the Rainbow Dress and Feather Robe.
